### The problem Beginner's Start solves :
The biggest problem for new learners learning a computer language is that once they learn the language they don't know where and how to implement it. Our platform provides beginners with a Bunch of Project Ideas that they can build. It contains Screenshots and snippets of how the code should look for them. Our website is currently in work but could be breifly viewied for basic use.

### Challenges I ran into : 
One of the main challenges we ran into was how to make projects which were easy to understand and with exact instructions the student has to follow. Another challenge we ran into was deciding which language we have to create projects for. So, we started to research regarding which language was currently popular on Github. After researching we found out that Python and Java were the most used Language in 2022 on Github. So, we decided to make projects using Java J.D.K 18 on Intelli J Idea and Python 4.10 on Visual Studio Code.
